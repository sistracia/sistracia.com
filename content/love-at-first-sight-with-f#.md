# Love at First Sight with F#

This project is my first toy project using F#. I made it for learning purpose, still on the very tip of iceberg.

Also currently I learning mobile development using Jetpack Compose and SwiftUI, and I'll use the API from the `web` app.

I feel the `web` app codebase getting unreadable as it's grow, maybe I will comeback later when I already good in F#

My thought of F# is it's cool, it's my first functional paradigm language I learned, and I like it.

## TODO I Want to Try
- [ ] Clean Up Codebase
- [ ] Add Subscription Feature
- [ ] Try FAKE instead of Makefile
- [ ] Build Android Client with Jetpack Compose
- [ ] Build Swift Client with SwiftUI
- [ ] Try Kotlin Multiplatform
