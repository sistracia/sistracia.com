## First I meet F#

Long time ago I want to learn some functional programming language, there is one functional programming language I know back then, it was [Clojure](https://clojure.org/). I know Clojure when I read some demo about functional paradigm in JavaScript. But when I read Clojure's documentation, turns out it's a dynamic type language, and that makes me not really to learn it.

After some searching, I found there are another functional programming languages, they are [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/?uwu=true), [Scalla](https://www.scala-lang.org/), and [OCaml](https://ocaml.org/), then the functional programming language I choose to learn is Haskell.... The reason I choose Haskell is because I already heard it before, from meme, and the language color in GitHub is purple.

The first step I took is open [Haskell website](https://www.haskell.org/), follow the [getting started page](https://www.haskell.org/get-started/), and done. I'm done, I'm not learning Haskell, because when I click the links on the Next Step section, my response is like "Hmm... maybe next time", because I learnt [Go](https://go.dev/) before and I expect something like [Go tour](https://go.dev/tour/) which I like it.

Few days later, I read something about [SAFE Stack](https://safe-stack.github.io/), it's stack related to [F#](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/). After I take a look at it I learn it. First the language color in GitHub is bright purple, it has some kind of [language tour](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/tour), it's from Microsoft, and it's interoperable with C# so we could use library written in C# in our F# project. So I continue my initial intent to learn functional programming language with F#.

## SAFE stack

As I mentioned before, SAFE Stack introduce me to F#. After I read the F# language tour, I straight tried to build something using SAFE Stack without do any searching for other tech in F#. I don't read the whole SAFE Stack documentation before start build my own F# project, I just follow [SAFE Dojo](https://github.com/CompositionalIT/SAFE-Dojo) that introduced in SAFE Stack documentation. After I finish it I create [my own project using F# and SAFE Stack](https://github.com/sistracia/rss-bookmarkr).
