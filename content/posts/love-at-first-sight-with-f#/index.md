## First I meet F#

Long time ago I want to learn some functional programming language, there is one functional programming language I know back then, it was [`Clojure`](https://clojure.org/). I know `Clojure` when I read some demo about functional paradigm in `JavaScript`. But when I read `Clojure`'s documentation, turns out it's a dynamic type language, and that makes me not really to learn it.

After some searching, I found there are another functional programming languages, they are [`Haskell`](https://www.haskell.org/?uwu=true), [`Scalla`](https://www.scala-lang.org/), and [`OCaml`](https://ocaml.org/), then the functional programming language I choose to learn is `Haskell`.... The reason I choose `Haskell` is because I already heard it before, from meme, and the language color in `GitHub` is purple.

The first step I took is open [`Haskell` website](https://www.haskell.org/), follow the [getting started page](https://www.haskell.org/get-started/), and done. I'm done, I'm not learning `Haskell`, because when I click the links on the Next Step section, my response is like "Hmm... maybe next time", because I learnt [`Go`](https://go.dev/) before and I expect something like [`Go` tour](https://go.dev/tour/) which I like it.

Few days later, I read something about [`SAFE Stack`](https://safe-stack.github.io/), it's stack related to [`F#`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/). After I take a look at it I learn it. First the language color in `GitHub` is bright purple, it has some kind of [language tour](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/tour), it's from `Microsoft`, and it's interoperable with `C#` so we could use library written in `C#` in our `F#` project. So I continue my initial intent to learn functional programming language with `F#`.

## SAFE stack

As I mentioned before, `SAFE Stack` introduce me to `F#`. After I read the `F#` language tour, I straight tried to build something using `SAFE Stack` without do any searching for other tech in `F#`. I don't read the whole `SAFE Stack` documentation before start build my own `F#` project, I just follow [`SAFE` Dojo](https://github.com/CompositionalIT/SAFE-Dojo) that introduced in `SAFE Stack` documentation. After I finish it I create [my own project using `F#` and `SAFE Stack`](https://github.com/sistracia/rss-bookmarkr).

## Experience with SAFE stack (docs, learning, searching for resource)

`SAFE Stack` stands for [`Saturn`](https://saturnframework.org/), [`Azure`](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us), [`Fable`](https://fable.io/), and [`Elmish`](https://elmish.github.io/elmish/). I skip the `Azure` part because I don't need it yet, so the first thing to learn is `Saturn`. I go to the `Saturn` documentation website, then go to the tutorial section, the first thing I see is the requirement not up-to-date, it's still require `dotnet` SDK 3.1 (since I first time open the dokucumentation until this post written), but I don't mind it and just follow the step-by-step anyway. When I follow the tutorial steps I'm not have smooth experience because there is typo in the documentation or maybe it's case-insensitive back then. The documentation said `dotnet new saturn -lang F#`, but turns out is supoosed to be `dotnet new Saturn -lang F#`. After I successfully init the `Saturn` project and follow the rest steps, it comes to last step which I run the project, and it failed because it the project generated by the template still use `net6.0` for the `TargetFramework`. I re-init the project start over from the scratch because I just want to know how to init the `S`~A~`FE` Stack step-by-step.

I start with init `F#` project with this `dotnet new webapi -lang F#` command, then I heard about [`Paket`](https://fsprojects.github.io/Paket/index.html) when I try the `SAFE` Dojo before, even tho I don't know what the advantage of it compare to the built-in `dotnet` package manager, it says "_Paket enables precise and predictable control over your dependencies_" in the documentation, but I dont have deep experience about those things yet, I just follow what I read.

I also try to use [`Fake`](https://fake.build/index.html), it's stands for "_F# Make_", from what I read from it's tools that can be used to replace the Shell-Script like `bash`, `cmd` and `powershell` with `F#` language, but I don't have a lot experience on Shell-Scripting, so I don't know the advantage of it. When I try to create simple `Fake` script in my [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with [`Ionide for F#`](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Ionide.Ionide-fsharp) already enabled, I see some red line one my screen and I don't know why, so I cancel to use `Fake`, maybe I'll give it try again later.

Then I install `Fable`, it's tools that can compile your `F#` project to `JavaScript`, not limited only to `JavaScript` tho, they have also supported some other languages. Besides `Fable` is one of pillar in `SAFE Stack`, the project I want to build is a web based apps and I will use [`Feliz`](https://zaid-ajaj.github.io/Feliz/) to build the UI like in the `SAFE` Dojo. `Feliz` is DSL in `F#` to make [`React`](https://react.dev/?uwu=true) apps without using `JavaScript`. What `Fable` do is just compile the `F#` to `JavaScript`, so it's still need another tools to run the produced `JavaScript` code, which tools like [`Vite`](https://vitejs.dev/) can be used to run the web app front-end.

I don't create the app in `React` style, but in [`Elm`](https://elm-lang.org/) style instead. I install `Elmish` to follow what I learned in `SAFE` Dojo. I read the `Elmish` documentation, I read the concept there, but I don't really get it in the first step, but after I practice it, it seems okay, but as long as the project grew, I'm not sure if I do it right. I found 2 projects use `Elmish` in advance [here](https://github.com/Zaid-Ajaj/Fable.Remoting#applications-using-remoting), when I compare those 2 projects to mine, I feel right something off in my project while those 2 projects feel neat in term of module separation, but I just keep continue working my project anyway.

As long as I continue my project with "_am I doing it right_" in my mind, when I write the code, there are some autocomplete suggestion in my editor for other properties or method from the `Elmish` package which make me thinking "_what is this property or method do_", then I search it the `Elmish` documentation, the explanation of the method I look for is not there, luckly it's open source, so sometimes I check the source code directly [here](https://github.com/elmish/elmish). `Elmish` also have other package to be used for doing something in `Elm` style, like these 2 package [`Elmish.Browser`](https://elmish.github.io/browser/) for browser routing & navigation in `Elm` style and [`Elmish.UrlParser`](https://elmish.github.io/urlParser/) for handle URL change, both package documentation don't really explain the package API reference same as `Elmish` one, only show some example, but is fun to learn tho.

## Next step

This is the first time I use both `F#` and `SAFE Stack` , `F` is my first functional programming language I learnt, and I'm not impressed yet so I keen to write more code in `F#`, seems like I not use it properly yet based on the first project I made. I'm also need to read or examine more project built on top of `SAFE Stack`, despite seems like I have complaint about some documentation before, maybe it's just me who use it wrong, I believe `SAFE Stack` is good. Both `F#` and `SAFE Stack` are not mainstream technology, so the way ahead will be tough, but to be honest I often use [`ChatGPT`](https://chat.openai.com/) and [`Claude.ai`](https://claude.ai/) to help me with the `F#` and they really help me.

So, see you.
